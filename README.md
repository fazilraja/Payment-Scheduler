## Development

To set up this App locally, clone this repo to your desktop, navigate to the frontend folder `cd frontend` and run `npm install` to install all the dependencies. Then `npm start` to launch the App.

To run the api and backend server, navigate to the backend folder. Then open a terminal in the backend folder and run `python3 -m venv venv`. Next, run the command `source venv/bin/activate` and finally install Flask using `pip3 install Flask`. Then to run the server, run `python3 server.py` in the same backend terminal.
